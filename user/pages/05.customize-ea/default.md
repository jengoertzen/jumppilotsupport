#### Customize Endless Aisle

There are a few ways you can customize Endless Aisle to work for you. **If you would like to make changes email Jen at [jenniferg@iqmetrix.com](mailto:jenniferg@iqmetrix.com).**

##### Home Screen

_Note: The home screen is sometimes referred to as the “startscreen.”_

This screen can be customised in three ways:
1. What it says: The main headline, “Browse 100s of Options Here!” can be changed to say whatever you like.
    * A lot hinges on what this says. It tells users what the screen can do and what they should do next.
2. What it’s linked to: Customize which categories you can access from this screen.
    * Example: If it’s primarily used for comparing phones, you could choose to only show smartphone brand names.
3. Appearance: There are five templates for home screens, depending on the look you want.

##### Categories

Categories are custom groupings of products. A category can include any grouping of products you choose. Products can be added individually, or by custom rules (e.g. include “only Smartphones,” exclude “Android”).

Examples:
* **Starter smartphone kit:** manually add most popular cases, cleaning items, charger, car mount, etc.
* **Latest Android smartphones:** create rule to include Type: Smartphone, Brand: Android, Release Date: Within last 3 months

An advantage of using rules is the products in the catalog will automatically update in real time based on what Jump is carrying. For example: If a category is made to include “Cases for iPhones,” every time a new case is added it will appear in the category on Endless Aisle.
