<p>There are a few ways you can customize Endless Aisle to work for you. If you would like to make changes email Jen at jenniferg@iqmetrix.com.</p>
<h5>Home Screen</h5>
<p><em>Note: The home screen is sometimes referred to as “startscreens.”</em></p>
<p>This screen can be customised in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>What it says: The main headline, “Browse 100s of Options Here!” can be changed to say whatever you like.
<ul>
<li>A lot hinges on what this says. It tells users what the screen can do and what they should do next.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What it’s linked to: Customize which categories you can access from this screen.
<ul>
<li>Example: If it’s primarily used for comparing phones, you could choose to only show smartphone brand names.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Appearance: There are five templates for home screens, depending on the look you want.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Categories</h5>
<p>Categories are custom groupings of products. A category can include any grouping of products you choose. Products can be added individually, or by custom rules (e.g. include “only Smartphones,” exclude “Android”).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starter smartphone kit: manually add most popular cases, cleaning items, charger, car mount, etc.</li>
<li>Latest Android smartphones: create rule to include Type: Smartphone, Brand: Android, Release Date: Within last 3 months</li>
</ul>
<p>An advantage of using rules is the products in the catalog will automatically update in real time based on what Jump is carrying. For example: If a category is made to include “Cases for iPhones,” every time a new case is added it will appear in the category on Endless Aisle.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
