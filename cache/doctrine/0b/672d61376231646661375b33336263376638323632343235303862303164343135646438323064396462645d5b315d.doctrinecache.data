<h5>Why use Compare?</h5>
<p>Customers like Compare for the same reason that you use brochures for rate plans and write out information on post-it notes: They like to see information visualized as you talk.</p>
<p>When they have access to the same information you do, customers have more trust in what you say—and, as a result, more trust in you. They also feel feel better about their final purchase because it feels like more research went into the decision. There’s less buyers’ remorse, more trust in the brand, and a more positive feeling around the whole purchase experience.</p>
<h3>Finding Items on Endless Aisle</h3>
<h4>By Category</h4>
<p>Products on Endless Aisle are organized into categories to make it easier to narrow down to only the relevant products.
You can access a category in the following places:
The home screen: The first view visible on Endless Aisle, also accessible via the “home” icon
“Shopping for” dropdown: On the “Browse by Category” view, tap the name of the category at the top left next to “Shopping for.”
Filter &amp; Sort: On Browse by Category, Shop For Your Device, and Search, tap “Filter” at the top right of the screen. A panel will slide down, now tap “Category” next to “Filter by” on the second row to view all categories.
Note: This is most useful in the Search view because only categories that exist within the product set currently visible will appear here. Example: If you are in the “Cases &amp; Protection” category, only the “Cases &amp; Protection” category will be visible in the dropdown.
Most Useful For
Browsing by category is most useful for exploring all of your options. It’s helpful for customers who want a product, but don’t have something specific in mind.
When you open the category, explain to the customer that this shows all of their options—both those in-store and available by Free Shipping.
Shop For Your Device
Shop For Your Device shows products within a category that are compatible with a specific device.
To open Shop For Your Device
Tap “Shop For Your Device” at the bottom left of the screen
If Endless Aisle is on the home screen, tap any category to open it.
Select the brand of the device.
Select the model.
Select the type of product.
You will now see a list of products within that category that are compatible with the selected device.
Note: If there are no compatible products for a device, the device, brand, or category will not appear in Shop For Your Device.
Most Useful For
When a customer has just purchased a device
When the customer has selected a device to buy and you need to set it up, pull up Shop For Your Device on Endless Aisle so they can browse accessories to go with their new device.
When a customer has an older or more obscure device
Stores can’t stock accessories for all devices all the time—the turnover is too fast! If a customer comes in with an older or more obscure device, use Shop For Your Device to show them their options available by Free Shipping.
